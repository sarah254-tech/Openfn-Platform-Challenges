 *
 * It also ensures the results of an operation make their way back into
 * the state's references.
 * @public
 * @example
 *  each("$.[*]",
 *    create("SObject",
 *    field("FirstName", sourceValue("$.firstName")))
 *  )
 * @function
 * @param {DataSource} dataSource - JSONPath referencing a point in `state`.
 * @param {Operation} operation - The operation needed to be repeated.
 * @returns {Operation}
