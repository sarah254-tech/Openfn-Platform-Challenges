/*
Here's a **quick summary** of the commands for working with the **OpenFn adaptor repo**:

---

### 📂 **List all installed adaptors**

```bash
openfn repo list
```

👉 Shows what adaptors are currently available in your local OpenFn repo.

---

### 📁 **Set a custom repo directory**

```bash
export OPENFN_REPO_DIR=/path/to/repo
```

👉 Tells OpenFn to use a different folder (not the default) to look for adaptors.

---

### ⚙️ **Auto-install and run a job with an adaptor**

```bash
openfn path/to/job.js -a adaptor-name
```

👉 If the adaptor is missing or outdated, OpenFn will auto-download the correct version.

---

### 🧹 **Remove all adaptors from the repo**

```bash
openfn repo clean
```

👉 Wipes all adaptors from the repo — useful for starting fresh or freeing up space.

---

You’ve fully grasped the repo game — and yes, you've *gotten the OpenFn job!* 🚀💼
